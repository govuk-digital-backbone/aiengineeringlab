# Team classification guide

> Detailed criteria and guidance for classifying teams as Starting, Developing, or Established.

## Purpose

This guide provides detailed criteria for classifying teams following the maturity assessment. It helps assessors make consistent classification decisions and helps teams understand what their classification means.

Use this guide to:

- make consistent classification decisions across teams
- explain classification rationale to teams
- identify specific areas for improvement
- plan appropriate support interventions

For the full assessment process, see 'Maturity assessment framework'.

## Classification overview

| Level | Description | Support model | Typical programme duration |
|-------|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Starting | Teams needing intensive support to begin adoption | Embedded forward deployed engineer (FDE), high-touch | 6 to 8 weeks to Developing |
| Developing | Teams building proficiency with moderate support | Shared FDE, blended | 4 to 6 weeks to Established |
| Established | Teams ready for self-sufficient adoption | On-demand consultation | Ongoing self-service |

## Starting classification

### Profile summary

Starting teams have limited AI assistant experience, face significant constraints, or have substantial barriers to adoption. They need intensive, hands-on support to successfully begin using AI coding assistants.

| High turnover | Significant team changes in past 6 months |
| Knowledge silos | One to 2 individuals hold key knowledge |
| Limited learning culture | No time allocated for learning, no knowledge sharing |

#### Delivery indicators

| Indicator | What it looks like |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Critical deadline pressure | Major delivery commitment within 8 weeks |
| Change fatigue | Team has undergone major changes recently |
| No protected time | Cannot allocate any time for training or adoption |

### What Starting teams need to progress

To progress to Developing classification, Starting teams need to demonstrate:

1. Basic tool proficiency – team can use AI for simple tasks.
2. Reduced resistance – no active blockers to adoption.
3. Established workflows – AI integrated into daily work.
4. Support sustainability – can work independently for short periods.
5. Champion emergence – at least one enthusiastic team member.

## Developing classification

### Scoring-based classification

If you use dimension scoring from the [Maturity Assessment Framework](maturity-assessment-framework.md):

| Average score | Classification |
|---------------|----------------|
| 1.0 to 1.7 | Starting |
| 1.8 to 2.4 | Developing |
| 2.5 to 3.0 | Established |

### Override conditions

Certain conditions override the score-based classification:

| Condition | Override |
|-----------|----------|
| No security approval | Maximum: Starting |
| Critical deadline within 4 weeks | Maximum: Starting |
| More than 50% active resistance | Maximum: Starting |
| No management support | Maximum: Starting |
| Air-gapped environment (cloud tools) | Not suitable for cloud AI tools |
| Active champions and more than 80% daily usage | Minimum: Developing |

### Borderline cases

For teams scoring near classification boundaries (for example, 1.7 to 1.8 or 2.4 to 2.5):

1. Review qualitative factors – do interview notes suggest higher or lower?
2. Consider trajectory – is the team improving or facing new challenges?
3. Apply "benefit of doubt" – when uncertain, classify lower to ensure adequate support.
4. Document rationale – record why borderline decision was made.
5. Plan early reassessment – schedule check-in at 2 weeks instead of 4.

## Common classification scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legacy modernisation team

Context: Team maintaining 15-year-old Java application, planning modernisation.

Assessment findings:

- technical: Java 8, Subversion, limited CI/CD (Score: 1)
- team: mixed experience, 30% used AI tools (Score: 2)
- delivery: modernisation starting in 3 months (Score: 2)
- security: OFFICIAL, standard requirements (Score: 3)
- attitudes: interested, see AI helping modernisation (Score: 2)
- ways of working: basic standards, reasonable testing (Score: 2)

Average: 2.0 leading to Developing classification.

Rationale: Despite legacy technical environment, team is stable, has capacity, and sees AI as helpful for modernisation. Developing classification with focus on legacy-specific techniques.

---

### Scenario 2: High-pressure delivery team

Context: Team building new citizen-facing service with go-live in 6 weeks.

Assessment findings:

- technical: modern stack, good CI/CD (Score: 3)
- team: experienced, 60% used AI tools (Score: 3)
- delivery: critical deadline in 6 weeks (Score: 1)
- security: OFFICIAL, approved (Score: 3)
- attitudes: enthusiastic but time-poor (Score: 2)
- ways of working: strong practices (Score: 3)

Average: 2.5 leading to Established classification.

However: Critical deadline override applies.

Classification: Starting (deferred)

Rationale: Despite strong indicators, team cannot allocate time for adoption. Recommend deferring intensive adoption until after go-live, with self-service resources available for interested individuals now.

### Scenario 3: Security-constrained team

Context: Team working on law enforcement system with strict security requirements.

Assessment findings:

- technical: modern but constrained environment (Score: 2)
- team: experienced, 40% AI experience (Score: 2)
- delivery: manageable workload (Score: 3)
- security: OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE, significant constraints (Score: 1)
- attitudes: positive but cautious about security (Score: 2)
- ways of working: strong practices (Score: 3)

Average: 2.2 leading to Developing classification.

Rationale: Developing classification but with security-focused onboarding. FDE engagement should focus on guardrails configuration and security-safe workflows. May need extended timeline for security approvals.

### Scenario 4: Resistant team

Context: Team where engineers are sceptical about AI tools.

Assessment findings:

- technical: good environment (Score: 3)
- team: experienced but negative prior AI experience (Score: 2)
- delivery: reasonable capacity (Score: 2)
- security: standard (Score: 3)
- attitudes: 40% resistant, 30% neutral, 30% positive (Score: 1)
- ways of working: strong (Score: 3)

Average: 2.3 leading to Developing classification.

Rationale: Despite good technical foundations, attitude score pulls down average. Developing classification with heavy change management focus. FDE should work with resistant individuals, demonstrating value, and building from the 30% who are positive.

### Scenario 5: Champion-ready team

Context: Team with several AI enthusiasts already experimenting.

Assessment findings:

- technical: modern, well-maintained (Score: 3)
- team: mixed, but 3 engineers already using AI extensively (Score: 3)
- delivery: stable, capacity available (Score: 3)
- security: OFFICIAL, approved (Score: 3)
- attitudes: enthusiastic, multiple potential champions (Score: 3)
- ways of working: strong practices (Score: 3)

Average: 3.0 leading to Established classification.

Rationale: Clear Established classification. Focus on enabling existing enthusiasts as champions, capturing their patterns for AI Engineering Lab repository, and connecting them to community. Light-touch support only.

## Classification communication

### Communicating to teams

When you share classification with teams:

Do:

- explain what the classification means for support they will receive
- frame as "matching support to needs" not judgement
- highlight strengths identified in assessment
- be clear about path to progression
- answer questions openly

Do not:

- present as a grade or ranking
- compare teams to each other
- make teams feel "behind"
- suggest classification is permanent
- dismiss concerns about classification

### Template for classification communication

| Support concern | FDE or delivery manager believes classification does not match reality |

### Progression approval

| Transition | Approval needed |
|------------|-------------------|
| Starting to Developing | FDE and programme team |
| Developing to Established | FDE and programme team |
| Downgrade (any) | Programme team and delivery manager agreement |

### Documenting progression

Record:

- previous classification and date
- new classification and date
