# AI Engineering Lab maturity assessment framework

> A structured approach to assessing team readiness and determining appropriate support levels for AI code assistant adoption.

## Purpose

This framework provides a consistent method for evaluating teams before AI Engineering Lab deployment. The assessment determines:

- current team maturity level at starting, developing, or established
- appropriate support intensity from the programme
- tailored adoption roadmap and training needs
- specific risks and blockers to work on

Every team entering the AI Engineering Lab programme completes this assessment as part of the initial onboarding and foundation phase.

## Maturity levels

### Level 1: starting

Teams with limited AI assistant experience, significant constraints, or substantial support needs.

| Dimension | Indicators |
|-----------|------------|
| Experience | Little or no prior AI assistant usage |
| Technical environment | Complex constraints, legacy systems, limited tooling |
| Team composition | Higher proportion of junior engineers |
| Change capacity | Limited bandwidth due to delivery pressures |
| Attitudes | Significant scepticism or resistance present |

The support model includes:

- embedded FDE support, with a dedicated FDE for 2 to 4 weeks
- intensive hands-on training, with face-to-face workshops
- daily check-ins during initial adoption
- high-touch change management

Typical duration to progress is 6 to 8 weeks to developing.

---

### Level 2: developing

Teams with some AI experience or good foundational capabilities, requiring moderate support to build proficiency.

| Dimension | Indicators |
|-----------|------------|
| Experience | Some team members have used AI assistants |
| Technical environment | Standard tooling, some constraints manageable |
| Team composition | Mix of experience levels |
| Change capacity | Reasonable bandwidth for adoption activities |
| Attitudes | Generally positive, some concerns to work on |

The support model includes:

- shared FDE support, with FDE covering multiple teams
- blended training, with a mix of self-paced and guided
- weekly check-ins
- standard change management approach

Typical duration to progress is 4 to 6 weeks to established.

---

### Level 3: established

Teams ready for largely self-sufficient adoption with minimal direct support.

Characteristics:

| Dimension | Indicators |
|-----------|------------|
| Experience | Multiple team members actively using AI assistants |
| Technical environment | Modern tooling, few constraints |
| Team composition | Experienced team with strong practices |
| Change capacity | Good bandwidth, proactive about adoption |
| Attitudes | Enthusiastic, potential champions identified |

The support model includes:

- self-service with on-demand FDE consultation
- self-paced training with optional workshops
- bi-weekly or monthly check-ins
- light-touch change management

Established teams often become role models and sources of champions for other teams.

## Scoring methodology

### Dimension scoring

Each dimension is scored 1 to 3 based on the following assessment findings.

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Starting | Most factors indicate significant challenges |
| 2 | Developing | Mix of factors, some challenges, some strengths |
| 3 | Established | Most factors indicate readiness |

### Overall classification

Calculate the average score across all six dimensions.

| Average score | Classification |
|---------------|----------------|
| 1.0 to 1.7 | Starting |
| 1.8 to 2.4 | Developing |
| 2.5 to 3.0 | Established |

### Classification override rules

Certain factors automatically constrain classification regardless of score.

| Condition | Maximum classification |
|-----------|------------------------|
| No security approval | Starting |
| Critical delivery deadline within 4 weeks | Starting |
| Over 50% team actively resistant | Starting |
| No management support | Starting |
| Air-gapped environment (for cloud tools) | Not suitable |

### Example scoring

| Dimension | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Technical environment | 2 | Standard Git, some legacy code |
| Team composition | 2 | Mixed experience, 30% used AI tools |
| Delivery context | 1 | Major release in 6 weeks |
| Security posture | 3 | OFFICIAL only, security approved |
| Attitudes | 2 | Cautiously positive, some concerns |
| Ways of working | 2 | Good testing, needs documentation |
| Average | 2.0 | Developing |

However, with a major release in 6 weeks, consider delaying intensive adoption or providing lighter-touch support until after the release.

## Assessment process

### 1. Preparation

Use the following checklist before each assessment begins.

- [ ] Identify team to be assessed
- [ ] Confirm delivery manager and technical lead availability for interviews
- [ ] Distribute questionnaires to all team members
- [ ] Set deadline for questionnaire completion (48 hours)
- [ ] Schedule interview slots

You should gather information on:

- the team size and composition
- the current project and delivery commitments
- the technology stack overview
- any known constraints or concerns

### 2. Questionnaire completion

| Questionnaire | Recipient | Time required |
|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| 'Delivery manager assessment' | Delivery manager | 20 to 30 minutes |
| 'Technical lead assessment' | Technical lead | 20 to 30 minutes |
| 'Individual engineer assessment' | All engineers | 15 to 20 minutes |

Distributed questionnaires should:

- be sent via email or Teams with clear deadline
- emphasise confidentiality of individual responses
- explain purpose and how results will be used
- provide contact for questions

### 3. Interviews

An interview led by the delivery manager, lasting 45 minutes, should:

- review questionnaire responses
- explore delivery context and constraints
- understand team dynamics and change history
- identify management support level
- discuss realistic time allocation

An interview led by the technical lead, lasting 45 minutes, should:

- review questionnaire responses
- deep-dive on technical environment
- understand security and compliance context
- identify technical blockers
- discuss integration approach

Interviews should:

- use questionnaire responses as starting point
- ask open-ended follow-up questions
- identify unstated concerns
- note specific examples given
- identify potential champions

### 4. Analysis and classification

Analysis activities should follow these steps. 

1. Aggregate individual engineer responses.
2. Score each dimension based on all inputs.
3. Calculate average score.
4. Apply override rules if applicable.
5. Identify specific risks and blockers.
6. Draft initial roadmap recommendations.

Review each classification to:

- discuss borderline cases with assessment team
- consider qualitative factors not captured in scoring
- ensure classification feels right given overall picture

### 5. Roadmap planning session

Sessions should be structured as follows, lasting 60 to 90 minutes.

| Segment | Duration | Content |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Assessment findings | 15 minutes | Share classification and findings |
| Discussion | 20 minutes | Work on questions, validate findings |
| Roadmap drafting | 30 minutes | Agree milestones and support approach |
| Next steps | 15 minutes | Confirm immediate actions |

Review roadmap elements, planning:

- target go-live date for AI tools
- training approach and scheduling
- FDE support allocation
- milestones and check-ins
- success metrics
- risk mitigations

## Progression between levels

Teams are expected to progress through maturity levels during the programme.

### Progression criteria: starting to developing

| Criterion | Evidence required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Tool activation | 100% of licences activated |
| Basic proficiency | Team completing basic prompts successfully |
| Reduced resistance | No active resistance blocking adoption |
| Support need reduction | Can work independently for short periods |
| Training completion | Core training modules completed |

### Progression criteria: developing to established

| Criterion | Evidence required |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Daily active usage | Over 80% of team using tools daily |
| Quality output | AI-generated code passing reviews consistently |
| Self-sufficiency | Minimal FDE support needed |
| Knowledge sharing | Team sharing tips and patterns internally |
| Champion active | At least one team champion contributing to community |

### Reassessment process

The reassessment process includes:

- a formal reassessment every 4-weeks during active adoption
- a lightweight check each week during FDE engagement
- a progression decision, made jointly by FDE, delivery manager, and programme team

---

## Special circumstances

### High-constraint environments

Teams with significant security or technical constraints may require:

- an extended assessment period
- a security-focused deep-dive
- a custom guardrails development
- a delayed deployment pending approvals

### Teams under delivery pressure

For teams with imminent deadlines:

- consider delaying intensive adoption
- offer awareness training only
- schedule full adoption for post-delivery
- provide self-service resources for interested individuals

### Distributed or multi-site teams

Consider and assess:

- each location if practices differ
- timezone impact on support
- remote training provision
- consistent tooling across sites

### Mixed-maturity teams

If assessment reveals significant variation within a team:

- consider splitting into cohorts
- pair experienced with inexperienced members
- provide differentiated training paths
- use internal champions for peer support

---

## Reporting and governance

### Assessment outputs

Each assessment should produce the following.

| Output | Audience | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Assessment summary | Team, programme | Overview of findings and classification |
| Detailed scoring | Programme team | Supporting evidence for classification |
| Risk register entries | Governance | Risks requiring monitoring |
| Roadmap | Team, programme | Agreed adoption plan |

### Programme-level reporting

Assessment data feeds into:

- a weekly dashboard, with teams assessed, classifications and blockers identified
- a cohort analysis, with patterns identified across similar teams
- resource planning, for FDE allocation and scheduling
- risk reporting, identifying aggregated risks across programme

### Continuous improvement

Assessment process improvements are based on:

- assessor feedback after each assessment
- team feedback on assessment experience
- accuracy of classifications, whether support level proved appropriate
- time-to-proficiency by classification
