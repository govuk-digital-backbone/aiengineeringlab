# Individual engineer assessment questionnaire

## Why we're asking for this information

This questionnaire helps us understand your experience, work context, and learning preferences so that we can provide the right support for you to adopt AI Engineering Labs effectively. There's no right or wrong answers because we want to understand what will help you work better.

**What happens next:** your responses, combined with questionnaires from your delivery manager and technical lead, help us design training, resources, and support that work for your specific needs and context.

**Time needed:** approximately 10 to 15 minutes

**Confidentiality:** your individual responses are only seen by the programme team and used to design support. We'll share aggregate patterns with your team leadership, but never individual responses.
