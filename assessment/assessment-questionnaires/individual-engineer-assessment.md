# Individual engineer assessment questionnaire

## Why we are asking for this information

This questionnaire helps us understand your experience, work context and learning preferences so we can provide the right support for you to adopt AI Engineering Labs effectively. There is no right or wrong answer - we want to understand what will help you work better.

## What happens next

Your responses, combined with questionnaires from your delivery manager and technical lead, help us design training, resources and support that work for your specific needs and context.

You will need approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete this questionnaire.

Your responses are confidential and will only seen by the programme team and used to design support. We will share aggregate patterns with your team leadership, but never individual responses.
