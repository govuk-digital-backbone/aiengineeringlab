# Delivery manager assessment questionnaire

## Why we are asking for this information

This questionnaire helps us understand your team's context so we can tailor the right support for adopting AI coding assistants. There are no right or wrong answers. We are gathering information to design an approach that works for your specific situation.

What happens next: Your responses, along with questionnaires from your technical lead and team engineers, help us determine the most effective adoption approach for your team. This might include customised training, specific guardrails, or additional hands-on support.

Time needed: Approximately 10 to 15 minutes

Confidentiality: We use your responses only to design your team's adoption plan. We do not share individual team data beyond the programme team.
