# Delivery manager assessment questionnaire

## Why we're asking for this information

This questionnaire helps us understand your team's context so that we can tailor the right support for adopting AI coding assistants. There's no right or wrong answers as we're gathering information to design an approach that works for your specific situation.

**What happens next:** your responses, along with questionnaires from your technical lead and team engineers, help us to determine the most effective adoption approach for your team. This might include customised training, specific guardrails, or additional hands-on support.

**Time needed:** approximately 10 to 15 minutes

**Confidentiality:** your responses are used only to design your team's adoption plan. No individual team data is shared beyond the programme team.
