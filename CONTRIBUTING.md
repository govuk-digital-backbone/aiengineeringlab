# Contributing to this repository

How to propose, submit, and review contributions to the AI Engineering Lab repository.

Thank you for your interest in improving this repository. Contributions from across government help keep these materials current, comprehensive, and practically useful.

## Before you contribute

### Who can contribute

This repository welcomes contributions from:

- civil servants across all government departments
- contractors and suppliers working on government projects
- arm's length bodies and agencies
- Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) capturing learnings from engagements

### Types of contribution

| Contribution type | Examples | Process |
|-------------------|----------|---------|
| Bug fixes | Typos, broken links, factual errors | Quick fix process |
| Minor improvements | Clarifications, additional examples, formatting | Standard process |
| New content | New playbooks, prompts, case studies | Full review process |
| Structural changes | New sections, reorganisation | Proposal required |
| Tool-specific guides | New AI assistant coverage | Full review and security assessment |

### What we are looking for

We welcome:

- practical examples from real adoption experiences
- prompts that have proven effective in government contexts
- case studies (anonymised where necessary)
- accessibility improvements
- corrections to outdated information
- integration patterns for government technology stacks
- translations or plain English improvements

### What requires additional review

Security or governance reviews are required before merging for:

- content relating to security controls or guardrails
- tool-specific configuration guidance
- incident response procedures
- any content mentioning specific vulnerabilities
- integration patterns involving authentication or secrets

### Writing style

All content must follow [GOV.UK content design principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/writing-for-gov-uk). Writers must:

- use plain English, avoid jargon, and explain technical terms on first use
- use active voice, such as 'Review the code' instead of 'The code should be reviewed'
- front-load information, putting the most important point first
- keep sentences short, aiming for 25 words or fewer per sentence
- use short paragraphs with one idea per paragraph, and 2 to 3 sentences maximum
- be direct, using 'you' to address the reader, and 'we' for the repository team

### Formatting standards

Headings must:

- use sentence case, capitalising the first word only
- use heading levels sequentially such as H2 to H3, instead of H2 to H4
- be kept descriptive and actionable

Lists must use:

- bullet points for unordered items
- numbered lists for sequential steps only

Numbered lists must:

- start each item with a capital letter
- end each item with a full stop
- not end with a question mark

Bullet lists must:

- use lower case, including the first letter, unless that item is a proper noun
- not use full stops at the end of list items, unless they are complete sentences

Code examples must:

- use fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- be concise and focused
- include comments explaining non-obvious elements
- be tested before before submitted

Links must:

- use descriptive link text, instead of 'click here'
- use relative links for internal repository references
- be checked and working before being submitted

## Accessibility requirements

- [ ] Use clear, simple language (aim for reading age 9)
- [ ] Provide alt text descriptions for any images
- [ ] Do not use colour alone to convey meaning

### Structure

- [ ] Use proper heading hierarchy
- [ ] Use semantic markup (lists, tables, headings)
- [ ] Keep tables simple and avoid merged cells
- [ ] Provide table headers for data tables

### Code examples

- [ ] Do not rely on syntax highlighting alone
- [ ] Include comments for complex logic
- [ ] Ensure examples are screen-reader friendly when rendered

### Cognitive accessibility

- [ ] Break complex content into manageable chunks
- [ ] Use consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Provide summaries for long documents
- [ ] Include practical examples alongside theory

For detailed guidance, see the repository's accessibility documentation.
