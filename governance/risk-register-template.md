# AI Engineering Lab risk register template

> A standardised template for documenting and managing risks associated with AI Engineering Lab adoption.

## Purpose

This template provides a consistent approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks across all AI Engineering Lab deployments. It aligns with government risk management frameworks and ensures risks are visible, owned, and actively managed.

Use this template to:

1. Document risks identified during assessments.
2. Track risks throughout the adoption lifecycle.
3. Provide assurance to senior responsible owners.
4. Support security accreditation processes.
5. Enable cross-government learning from risk patterns.

## How to use this template

1. Copy this template for each department or programme deployment.
2. Complete the risk register using the pre-populated common risks as a starting point.
3. Add deployment-specific risks identified during assessment.
4. Assign owners for each risk.
5. Review regularly (minimum monthly during active adoption).
6. Escalate risks that exceed tolerance to programme governance.

## Risk assessment methodology

### Likelihood scoring

| Score | Likelihood | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Rare | May occur only in exceptional circumstances (less than 5% probability) |
| 2 | Unlikely | Could occur but not expected (5% to 20% probability) |
| 3 | Possible | Might occur at some point (20% to 50% probability) |
| 4 | Likely | Will probably occur in most circumstances (50% to 80% probability) |
| 5 | Almost certain | Expected to occur (more than 80% probability) |

### Impact scoring

| Score | Impact | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Negligible | Minor inconvenience, no lasting effect |
| 2 | Minor | Limited impact, resolved within normal operations |
| 3 | Moderate | Noticeable impact requiring management attention |
| 4 | Major | Significant impact on objectives, requires senior attention |
| 5 | Severe | Critical impact, potential for lasting damage or regulatory breach |

### Risk rating matrix

|              | Negligible (1) | Minor (2) | Moderate (3) | Major (4) | Severe (5) |
|--------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Almost certain (5) | 5 (Medium) | 10 (Medium) | 15 (High) | 20 (Very high) | 25 (Very high) |
| Likely (4) | 4 (Low) | 8 (Medium) | 12 (High) | 16 (High) | 20 (Very high) |
| Possible (3) | 3 (Low) | 6 (Medium) | 9 (Medium) | 12 (High) | 15 (High) |
| Unlikely (2) | 2 (Low) | 4 (Low) | 6 (Medium) | 8 (Medium) | 10 (Medium) |
| Rare (1) | 1 (Low) | 2 (Low) | 3 (Low) | 4 (Low) | 5 (Medium) |

### Risk tolerance thresholds

| Rating | Score range | Response required |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Very high | 20 to 25 | Immediate escalation to senior responsible owner; consider stopping activity |
| High | 12 to 19 | Active management required; escalate to programme board |
| Medium | 5 to 11 | Monitor and manage; include in regular reporting |
| Low | 1 to 4 | Accept and monitor; review at next scheduled assessment |
