# Sustainable AI net benefit

## Introduction

You must evaluate AI climate impact using more than direct emissions. You must consider wider system effects. This page summarises research that examines AI net carbon impact. It looks at training and inference emissions against reductions in energy, transport, agriculture and industry.

## Net climate benefit frameworks

### MIT Sloan net climate impact score

Jennifer Turliuk created a method to evaluate AI climate trade offs. Her 2025 MIT MBA thesis describes the method.

The framework:

- compares AI emissions from training and inference against emissions avoided through AI enabled efficiency
- introduces a Net Climate Impact Score to quantify benefit

Research found that:

- many current AI applications have short term net negative impact
- AI used in energy systems can achieve net positive impact within years
- early carbon reductions matter more than later reductions

### Nature and LSE and Systemiq system level modelling

This is the most detailed study of AI climate impact at scale.

Research found that:

- AI could reduce between 3.2 and 5.4 gigatonnes of CO2e each year by 2035
- savings include emissions from data centres, training and inference
- net savings outweigh AI emissions

Example impact areas include:

- power grids with around 20% improvement in renewable use
- food systems with faster adoption of alternative proteins
- mobility with improved routing and shared transport use

## Proven sector applications

### Google DeepMind wind farm optimisation

This uses continuous inference workloads in data centres.

Benefits achieved:

- increased wind farm output value by around 20%
- reduced curtailment, allowing more zero carbon electricity on the grid

Net effect showed carbon savings many times larger than compute emissions.

### Kilimo agriculture precision irrigation

AI emissions include cloud based models and satellite data processing.

Benefits achieved:

- 30% reduction in water use
- reduced pumping energy
- 20% to 40% financial return for farmers

This created environmental and economic benefits.

### Data centre self optimisation

AI reduces data centre emissions through:

- dynamic cooling optimisation
- shifting load to lower carbon grid hours
- improving hardware use

Research from MIT and CSAIL shows AI efficiency gains help control emissions from growing data centre use.

## Economic and systemic perspectives

### PwC economy wide efficiency multiplier

PwC found that AI can offset its own energy use. This happens if AI improves economy wide efficiency at around 10% of its adoption rate.

Application areas include:

- smart building energy control
- logistics and aviation routing
- cement and materials development

AI works as an efficiency multiplier.

### Energy sector modelling timeline considerations

AI is expected to increase net emissions until around 2030. After around 2035 AI optimisation of energy production, storage and use should reduce emissions. This follows typical infrastructure transitions.

Reference: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.10750v1)

## Where net benefit claims fail

Not all AI applications create positive net impact.

Problem cases include:

- large scale consumer generative AI without clear efficiency benefit
- redundant model training without system benefit
- data centres powered by fossil fuels with no optimisation role

Research shows that AI can increase local emissions if grids are carbon intensive.

## UK public sector AI investment and return on investment

### National AI strategy and investment landscape

The UK government aims to use AI to support economic growth and public service transformation.

Major funding includes:

- £2 billion for AI Opportunities Action Plan to 2029 to 2030
- up to £10 billion for NHS technology and digital transformation to 2028 to 2029

### NHS quantified outcomes and cost savings

### Microsoft 365 Copilot trial 2025

More than 30,000 NHS staff in 90 organisations took part.

Time savings include:

- around 43 minutes saved per staff member each day
- around 5 weeks saved per staff member each year
- up to 400,000 hours saved each month with full roll out

Cost impact indicated:

- millions of pounds saved each month based on 100,000 users
- more than 83,000 hours saved in meeting note taking each month
- 271,000 hours saved each month summarising email

This allows staff to spend more time on patient care.

- at least 5,000 jobs expected
- £78 billion invested in UK AI since the last change of government

Commercial commitments include:

- Groq opening the first UK data centre in London at around £100 million
- Graphcore and SoftBank creating a new Bristol lab with 750 jobs

### Challenges and critical perspectives

Concerns include:

- £3.35 billion in AI contracts since 2018 but skewed to infrastructure  
- underfunding in high impact public services  
- only 20% of procurement spend goes to SMEs  
- limited evidence of patient outcomes in NHS AI Lab evaluation  
- digital infrastructure gaps  
- need for cultural change in procurement  
- low public trust in companies handling patient data

## Framework for responsible justification

A credible net benefit argument must include:

- direct emissions in kgCO2e from training, inference and infrastructure
- system level emissions avoided through specific mechanisms
- time to breakeven showing when benefits exceed costs
- wider social and economic benefits

Template statement:

```
This AI system emits X kgCO2e, but enables Y kgCO2e avoided elsewhere within Z years.
```

### Implementation guidance

#### For architecture and sustainability teams

You should:

- prioritise AI applications with clear system level benefits  
- calculate time discounted emissions  
- document costs and avoided emissions  
- include grid carbon intensity  
- plan for transparent reporting  

#### Red flags for weak justifications

Weak justifications include:

- vague efficiency claims  
- ignoring breakeven  
- ignoring grid carbon intensity  
- missing social or economic benefits  
- missing sector comparisons  

#### UK specific considerations

You should:

- align with National AI Strategy  
- support SME inclusion  
- comply with UK AI regulation  
- build public trust  
- show taxpayer value
