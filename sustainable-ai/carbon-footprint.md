# Carbon footprint of AI coding assistants

A kgCO2e analysis of different AI coding assistants.

## Introduction

You need to understand the carbon footprint of AI coding assistants to support sustainable technology decisions. This document sets out carbon emission estimates in kilograms of CO2 equivalent for four AI tools used in the DSIT AI Engineering Lab programme. These tools are GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, Claude Code and Gemini Code Assist.

AI companies rarely publish emissions data. The estimates here come from independent research, academic studies and vendor information where available. Treat these figures as indicative. Actual emissions vary by infrastructure, data centre location and usage patterns.

## Understanding kgCO2e

kgCO2e means kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent. This measures greenhouse gas emissions by converting all gases into equivalent CO2 based on warming potential.

1kg of CO2e is equivalent to:

- driving a petrol car for around 2.5 miles
- charging a smartphone around 120 times
- watching around 5 hours of streamed video
- making around 5,000 online searches

## Carbon emissions from inference and training

Inference now represents more than 80% of total AI electricity use. Training uses significant power but takes place far less often. Inference happens for every interaction and creates most operational emissions.

Inference emissions for coding assistants serving large engineering teams exceed the training emissions spread across the model lifetime.

## Estimated carbon footprint by tool

Hannah Ritchie's ['What's the carbon footprint of using ChatGPT or Gemini?'](https://hannahritchie.substack.com/p/ai-footprint-august-2025) provides an analysis of AI emissions estimates and methodology comparison across major models.

['Carbon Footprint Evaluation of Code Generation through LLM as a Service'](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-45010-6_15) sets out a framework for evaluating embodied and operational carbon in code generation tasks.

Multiple sources from 2023 to 2025 support the industry consensus that inference now represents more than 80% of total AI electricity consumption, exceeding training as the primary driver of operational emissions.

## Factors affecting actual emissions

### Usage patterns

Chat interactions produce higher emissions because they use larger context windows:

- generating between 3 and 5 times more emissions
- increasing emissions by around 400% when prompts are poor
- generating between 10 and 30 times more emissions when using reasoning models

### Infrastructure variables

Emissions vary by data centre location.

| Location | Typical CO2 per kilowatt hour consumption |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| France | 56 grams |
| UK | 230 grams |
| Germany | 380 grams |
| USA | 445 grams |

Hardware efficiency varies. Efficiency is typically increased with:

- H100 and H200 GPUs
- Google TPUs designed for inference
- modern data centres with power use effectiveness of 1.1 to 1.2

Age of infrastructure also affects efficiency. Emissions typically increase with:

- older GPUs, as energy use increases
- older facilities, which may have PUE between 1.5 and 2.0

### Temporal factors

Model updates improve efficiency. Renewable energy availability varies with season and time of day.

## Sustainability recommendations

### Tool selection

Gemini Code Assist provides the lowest carbon footprint where efficiency is the priority. Amazon Q offers balanced efficiency and strong sustainability commitments. Select models based on functional need and carbon impact.

### Usage optimisation

You can reduce emissions through:

- inline suggestions instead of chat where practical
- precise prompts that reduce token output
- early cancellation of unneeded generation
- smaller models for simple tasks

### Monitoring and reporting

You should support sustainability by:

- monitoring usage and token patterns
- setting guidance for efficient consumption
- reporting carbon metrics in programme reporting
- helping engineers understand environmental impact

## Limitations and caveats

### Data transparency

Most vendors do not publish per-query emissions. Estimates use academic research, industry benchmarks and limited disclosures.

### Scope boundaries

The estimates cover scope 3 inference emissions. They exclude training emissions, device power use, network energy use, embodied carbon and wider infrastructure overhead.

### Variability

Actual emissions vary by prompt complexity, response length, grid intensity and server load. The range can vary by 2 to 5 times.

## Conclusion

Carbon footprints vary across AI coding assistants. Gemini Code Assist shows the lowest emissions. Claude Code shows the highest. Programme scale use across 500 engineers results in annual emissions between 0.17 and 4.4 tonnes CO2e depending on tool choice.

While these emissions are modest compared to other organisational activities (equivalent to 1 to 28 return trips from London to Edinburgh), they represent an opportunity for informed decision-making. As AI adoption scales across government, tool selection based on efficiency, combined with optimised usage patterns, can meaningfully reduce environmental impact while maintaining productivity gains.

You should:

- include carbon footprint in tool comparison framework
- request vendor transparency on emissions data
- monitor usage patterns and intervene on inefficient consumption
- educate users on the environmental context of AI tool usage
- report carbon metrics alongside productivity and adoption data
