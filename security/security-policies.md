# AI Coding Assistant Security Policy

> Organisational security policy for the adoption and use of AI coding assistants in UK government contexts.

## Purpose

This document establishes the security policy framework for AI coding assistant adoption across government. It defines:

- policy scope and applicability
- roles and responsibilities
- policy statements (mandates)
- compliance and assurance requirements
- exception and escalation processes

This policy governs the [guardrails base](../governance/guardrails-base.md) and all department-specific extensions. The guardrails provide technical controls. This policy provides the governance mandate.

---

## Policy statements

### PS-01: tool approval required

 AI coding assistants must be approved before use on government projects.

#### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Security assessment | Tool must be assessed against this policy and threat model |
| Data protection | DPIA required where personal data may be processed |
| Vendor assessment | Supplier must meet government vendor security requirements |
| Configuration | Tool must be configurable to meet guardrails |
| Audit capability | Tool must provide adequate logging for accountability |

Authority: AI Security Lead approves tools; SIRO approves L5 autonomous tools.

This requirement ensures that organisations select AI coding assistants appropriate to their specific security context, as outlined in the [UK AI Playbook for Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html) Principle 6.

---

### PS-02: data classification compliance

AI coding assistants must only be used with data appropriate to their accreditation level.

#### Requirements

| Classification | Requirement |
|----------------|-------------|
| OFFICIAL | Permitted with standard controls (guardrails-base) |
| OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE | Permitted only with enterprise licence providing enhanced controls, and tool-specific accreditation |
| SECRET | Not permitted with any current AI coding assistant |
| TOP SECRET | Not permitted with any current AI coding assistant |

#### Prohibited data types include (regardless of classification):

- authentication credentials, API keys, tokens, certificates
- personal data (PII) unless anonymised
- security configurations (firewall rules, WAF configs)
- active case or investigation data
- export controlled content

#### Controls
 G-DH-01 through G-DH-05

This policy enforces [Government Security Classifications](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) boundaries and implements [NCSC Cloud Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud-security) for data handling.

---

### PS-03: mandatory human oversight

AI-generated code must be reviewed by a human before deployment.

#### Requirements

| Autonomy level (L) | Human oversight requirement |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| L1 to L2 (Suggestive/Assistive) | Human accepts each suggestion, review before commit |
| L3 (Collaborative) | Human review at checkpoints, review before merge |
| L4 (Autonomous) | Human review at checkpoints and time intervals, review before merge |
| L5 (Fully Autonomous) | Continuous monitoring capability, dual approval for merge |

Meaningful review means the reviewer:

- understands what the code does
- has verified no obvious security issues
- has confirmed tests pass and are meaningful
- has verified compliance with coding standards

Rubber stamping of AI output does not constitute meaningful review.

Controls: G-CS-01, G-AG-06, G-AG-07


This policy aligns with the [UK AI Playbook for Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html) Principle 4 (Human control at the right stage) and the [NCSC ML Security Principles](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Principles-for-the-security-of-machine-learning.pdf) section 1.2 on human oversight.


---

### PS-04: secure development integration

AI-generated code must pass through the same security controls as human-written code.

#### Requirements

| Control type | Requirement |
|--------------|-------------|
| Static analysis (SAST) | Mandatory before merge |
| Dependency scanning | Mandatory before merge |
| Secret detection | Mandatory (pre-commit hook preferred) |
| Dynamic analysis (DAST) | Where applicable, before production deployment |
| Container scanning | Where applicable, before deployment |

AI-generated code must not bypass security gates. The origin of code (human or AI) does not exempt it from security requirements.

Controls: G-CS-02

AI-generated code must be treated identically to human-written code throughout the secure development lifecycle, as outlined in [NCSC Secure Development and Deployment](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/developers-collection) and [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/).

---

### PS-05: agentic AI governance

AI tools with autonomous capabilities must be governed proportionate to their autonomy level.

#### Requirements

| L3 | Checkpoint controls, branch isolation recommended |
| L4 | Checkpoint controls, time limits, kill switch required, branch isolation required |
| L5 | SIRO approval required, security assessment required, enhanced monitoring, dual approval for output |

L5 tools are not approved for general use without explicit SIRO approval and dedicated security assessment.

Controls: G-AG-01 through G-AG-08

This policy aligns with the [UK AI Playbook for Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html) Principle 4 on human control, the [Anthropic Responsible Scaling Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) on AI safety, and [OWASP Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/agentic-ai-threats-and-mitigations/) guidance on autonomous system security.
