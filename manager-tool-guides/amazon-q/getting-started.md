# Amazon Q getting started guide

> Autonomous AI development environment that works alongside developers through specification-driven workflows and persistent context.
    
## Purpose
This guide provides engineers with getting started guidance for implementing Amazon Q within UK government departments. It covers system requirements, supported IDE, licence and installation guide to support informed decision-making and sustainable adoption.

## Who this is for

Advanced AI tools should be used by:

- software engineers working on complex, long-lived applications
- technical leads evaluating autonomous coding tools
- API engineers and backend teams requiring structured development
- engineering teams needing persistent, context-aware AI assistance
- delivery managers responsible for AI Engineering Lab adoption in their teams

## Getting started
[Amazon Q Developer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/what-is-amazon-q-developer.html) is AWS' AI powered coding assistant that helps with software development tasks throughout the entire development lifecycle. It evolved from Amazon CodeWhisperer and now includes enhanced capabilities like agentic coding, autonomous task execution, and multi-language support. It works inside IDEs, on the command line, and inside the AWS Console.
