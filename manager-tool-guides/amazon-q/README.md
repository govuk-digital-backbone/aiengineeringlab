## How it compares with other AI Engineering Lab tools

| Capability | Amazon Q Engineer | GitHub Copilot | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inline completion | Good | Excellent | Not available |
| Chat assistance | Good | Good | Excellent |
| Codebase understanding | Repository-wide | Current file only | Multi-file context |
| Execution capability | Limited | No | No |
| AWS integration | Native | Limited | Via API |
| Security scanning | Built-in | Separate tool | Not available |
| Code transformation | Java upgrades | Not available | Manual |
| Primary use case | AWS workflows | Fast completion | Reasoning tasks |

Choose Amazon Q when:

- your team primarily works with AWS services
- you need integrated security scanning in your workflow
- Java modernisation is a priority
- you want built-in code review capabilities
- your infrastructure is primarily AWS-based
- you need assistance with AWS CLI and CloudFormation

Consider combining with other tools to:

- use GitHub Copilot for faster inline completions in non-AWS contexts
- use Claude Code for complex architectural reasoning
- use Claude with AWS MCP server for enhanced AWS resource management
- combine Q's security scanning with manual security reviews

### AWS MCP server for enhanced workflows

The AWS MCP (Model Context Protocol) server enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with AWS resources, providing complementary capabilities to Amazon Q's native AWS integration.

AWS MCP server capabilities include:

- resource management for querying and managing AWS resources across services
- cost analysis for reviewing AWS spending and optimisation opportunities
- security posture analysis for IAM policies and security configurations
- infrastructure review for examining CloudFormation and Terraform configurations
- service recommendations for guidance on AWS service selection

#### Example workflow combining Amazon Q and AWS MCP

1. Engineer uses Amazon Q inline suggestions for AWS SDK code.
2. Engineer uses Q Chat for CloudFormation template generation.
3. Engineering manager uses Claude with AWS MCP server to review infrastructure security.
4. Claude analyses IAM policies and suggests least-privilege improvements.
5. Manager reviews AI analysis and implements approved changes.

#### Setting up AWS MCP server

The AWS MCP server is available for use with Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants. For configuration details, see [AWS MCP server documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/aws).

#### Government considerations:

The AWS MCP server requires IAM credentials with appropriate permissions. You should:
- use IAM roles with least-privilege access
- configure resource-level permissions to limit scope
- review data handling policies with your security team
- ensure compliance with your department's AWS usage policies
- consider using read-only permissions for analysis tasks

## Q models and task suitability

Amazon Q Engineer uses different models optimised for various development tasks. Understanding model capabilities helps set appropriate expectations and choose the right approach.

### Model comparison

| Model | Best for | Response time | Context window | Cost tier |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Amazon Q Engineer | Code generation, AWS integration, general development | Fast (1 to 2 seconds) | Large (100,000 or more tokens) | Standard |
| Amazon Q Engineer Pro | Advanced features, security scanning, transformations | Fast (1 to 2 seconds) | Large (100,000 or more tokens) | Premium |

Amazon Q uses AWS's proprietary models optimised for code generation and AWS service integration. Unlike some competitors, Q does not expose multiple model options to users - the appropriate model is selected automatically based on the task.

### Recommended features by task

| Task | Recommended approach | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Autocomplete as you type | Inline suggestions | Optimised for fast, context-aware completions |
| Generate unit tests | Agent mode (Pro) | Can create comprehensive test suites |
| Debug AWS integration issues | Q Chat | Direct access to AWS documentation and patterns |
| Write CloudFormation templates | Q Chat | Trained on AWS infrastructure patterns |
| Refactor legacy code | Agent mode (Pro) | Multi-file understanding and modification |
| Security code review | Code review feature (Pro) | Built-in security scanning |
| Upgrade Java applications | Code transformation (Pro) | Specialised for Java version migrations |
| Generate documentation | Q Chat | Good natural language generation |
| Implement AWS SDK calls | Inline suggestions | Trained on AWS SDK patterns |
| Optimise AWS costs | Q Chat | Can suggest cost-effective alternatives |

### Controlling feature usage

In Amazon Q, you interact with different capabilities through IDE commands and chat commands.

IDE commands include:
- `/dev` - agent mode for feature implementation
- `/test` - generate unit tests
- `/doc` - generate documentation
- `/review` - security and code quality review
- `/transform` - code transformation (Java upgrades)

You can ask questions directly in Q chat. You can also:
- reference workspace with `@workspace`
- get AWS-specific help with service names

## Government-specific considerations

For detailed guidance on security, privacy, and compliance requirements for AI Engineering Lab tools, see the [Security, privacy and compliance guide](../../governance/README.md).

This section covers Amazon Q-specific considerations.

### Security classification

Amazon Q Engineer processes code snippets through AWS services. This means it is generally acceptable for OFFICIAL classification with appropriate content exclusions configured. OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE requires risk assessment and strict content exclusions. SECRET and above classifications are not appropriate for this tool.

Consult your departmental security team before deployment. Reference [NCSC guidance on cloud services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles) for risk assessment.

### Content exclusions

You must configure Amazon Q to exclude sensitive files and patterns. Recommended exclusions for government projects:

```yaml
# Environment and configuration files
/.env
/.env.*
/secrets/
/config/production.yml
/config/production/

# AWS credentials and configuration
/credentials
/.aws/credentials
/.aws/config
/aws-exports.js

# API keys and tokens
/api-keys/
/*-key.json
/*-credentials.json

# Department-specific patterns
/citizen-data/
/personal-identifiable-information/
/security-configurations/
/terraform/production/
```

### Data residency

Amazon Q Engineer processes requests through AWS services in AWS regions. As of January 2025, code suggestions are processed in AWS US regions. No customer code is stored or used for model training. Telemetry data follows AWS data residency policies.

Check your department's data residency requirements before deployment. For UK government, verify compliance with data sovereignty requirements.

### Intellectual property

Amazon Q Engineer Pro includes IP indemnity, meaning AWS provides legal protection if generated code infringes copyright. Free tier does not include this protection.

For government projects, use Amazon Q Engineer Pro only.

### Risk management

- AWS best practice compliance

### Qualitative feedback

You should conduct monthly engineer surveys.

1. How often do you use Amazon Q? (Daily, Weekly, Rarely, Never)
2. For which tasks is Amazon Q most helpful?
3. How helpful are the AWS-specific features?
4. Has Amazon Q affected your productivity? (Much faster, Somewhat faster, No change, Slower)
5. Do you feel confident reviewing Q-generated code?
6. How useful is the security scanning feature?

## Common implementation challenges

### Challenge: engineers not using the tool

Symptoms include:
- low activation rates after 2 weeks
- acceptance rates below 15%
- feedback indicates suggestions are "not helpful"

Interventions.

1. Check content exclusions are not too restrictive.
2. Verify engineers understand keyboard shortcuts.
3. Provide pairing sessions with effective users.
4. Share specific AWS use case examples.
5. Demonstrate agent mode for complex tasks.
6. Show security scanning benefits.

### Challenge: security concerns from team

Symptoms include:
- engineers questioning code suggestions
- reluctance to accept any generated code
- requests to disable tool

Interventions.

1. Clarify that code review process remains unchanged.
2. Demonstrate content exclusion configuration.
3. Show built-in security scanning features.
4. Reference IP indemnity coverage.
5. Share NCSC guidance compliance.
6. Demonstrate that Q helps identify security issues.

### Challenge: over-reliance on suggestions

Symptoms include:
- decreased code review thoroughness
- accepting suggestions without understanding them
- reduced manual problem-solving attempts

Interventions.

1. Reinforce code review standards.
2. Include "understanding of implementation" in review checklist.
3. Encourage treating suggestions as first drafts.
4. Pair junior engineers with seniors during adoption.
5. Emphasise security scanning as complement, not replacement.

### Challenge: AWS-specific confusion

Symptoms include:
- suggestions do not match team's AWS patterns
- generated CloudFormation templates need significant modification
- confusion about AWS service recommendations

Interventions.

1. Provide AWS-specific training on Q usage.
2. Create internal library of effective AWS prompts.
3. Document team's AWS architecture patterns.
4. Use Q Chat to ask clarifying questions about AWS services.
5. Use agent mode for complex AWS integrations.

### Challenge: variable suggestion quality

Symptoms include:
- inconsistent helpfulness across different codebases
- better suggestions in some languages than others
- suggestions do not match project patterns

Interventions.

1. Improve context through better comments and function signatures.
2. Ensure relevant code is visible in workspace.
3. Use Q Chat for complex scenarios instead of inline.
4. Check if content exclusions are blocking helpful context.
5. Use agent mode for multi-file context understanding.

## Integration with development workflow

### Code review process

Amazon Q-generated code should pass through the same review process as human-written code. You should check the following things.

1. Logic correctness and edge case handling.
2. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data.
3. Compliance with team coding standards.
4. Appropriate error handling.
5. Security implications considered (use `/review` command).
6. AWS best practices followed.
7. Test coverage adequate.
8. Performance and cost characteristics acceptable.
9. IAM permissions follow least-privilege principle.

Using Q's built-in code review:

Before submitting PRs, engineers should run:
```
/review
```

This triggers Amazon Q's security and code quality scan, which checks for security vulnerabilities, code quality issues, AWS best practice violations, and potential bugs.

Responsible use guidance involves:

- reviewing all AI-generated code with the same rigour as human-written code
- understanding the code before accepting it into your codebase
- testing thoroughly, especially AWS integrations and error conditions
- being aware of potential security vulnerabilities in suggestions
- maintaining accountability, such as the engineer approving the code is responsible for it
- using `/review` command but do not rely on it exclusively

### Git workflow

No changes needed to your existing Git workflow. Amazon Q operates at the IDE level and does not affect commits, branches, or merges.

Some teams choose to document AI usage in commit messages:

```
feat: Add S3 bucket lifecycle policy

Implemented lifecycle rules using Amazon Q assistance for
AWS SDK integration. Security scan passed. IAM permissions reviewed.
```

This is optional and should align with your team's commit message conventions.

### Testing strategy

Treat Amazon Q-generated code as untested until proven otherwise.

1. Unit tests: use `/test` command to generate test scaffolding, then review and enhance.
2. Integration tests: manually verify AWS service interactions.
3. Security tests: run `/review` and SAST tools on all code.
4. AWS-specific tests: test IAM permissions, resource limits, error handling.
5. Manual review: code review remains mandatory.

### CI/CD pipeline

Amazon Q does not require changes to your pipeline. Ensure existing quality gates remain in place by including:

- linting and formatting checks
- unit test execution and coverage thresholds
- static analysis and security scanning
- integration and end-to-end test suites
- AWS resource validation (CloudFormation linting, and similar)

Generated code must pass all gates before merging.

Optional enhancement: consider integrating Amazon Q security scanning into CI/CD for automated security checks.

## Policy configuration reference
