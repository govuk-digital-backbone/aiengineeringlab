- the [AI Engineering Lab maturity assessment](../../assessment/maturity-assessment-framework.md) framework

## What Claude Code does

Claude Code is an AI-powered software development assistant that helps developers design, write, test, and maintain code through natural language conversation. Unlike inline autocomplete tools, Claude Code understands full codebases and performs multi-step tasks autonomously.

Primary capabilities include:

- exploring and understanding entire codebases and navigating dependencies
- editing multiple files whilst maintaining consistency across the project
- running terminal commands including tests, builds, lints, and Git operations
- generating and maintaining code documentation and API references
- creating test cases, generating test data, and running test suites
- analysing errors, identifying root causes, and suggesting fixes
- modernising legacy code and applying design patterns
- integrating with GitHub, GitLab, and development tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

### Claude Code interaction modes

Claude Code supports multiple interaction modes. Each is designed for a different stage of software development.

| Mode | Description | Best suited for |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Terminal | Command-line interface for development workflows | Daily coding, complex multi-step tasks, codebase exploration |
| IDE integration | Visual editing inside VS Code or JetBrains | Inline edits, side-by-side code changes, file navigation |
| Web browser | Browser-based access at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) | Quick tasks, parallel sessions, no installation required |
| Agent mode | Autonomous multi-step task execution with approval | Complex refactoring, migrations, end-to-end feature development |

You should:

- use the terminal for daily development work and complex codebase tasks
- use IDE integration for visual editing alongside existing workflows
- use the web browser for quick one-off tasks or when working without a local setup
- use agent mode for large, multi-step tasks that span multiple files

### Best suited for

Claude Code is best suited for:

- teams working on complex codebases requiring deep contextual understanding
- projects involving legacy code modernisation or large-scale refactoring
- engineers needing a conversational development partner rather than autocomplete
- teams using MCP servers to connect AI to government systems and standards

### Not designed for

Claude Code is not designed for:

- replacing code review and quality assurance processes
- making decisions about architecture without human oversight
- accessing classified systems or data above OFFICIAL
- autonomous deployment without human approval at each stage

## How it compares with other AI code assistants

For a detailed comparison of Claude Code with other AI code assistants, see the [comparative guidance](../comparative-guidance.md).

### Quick comparison

| AI tool | What it is | Strengths |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| Claude Code | CLI and IDE assistant with deep codebase understanding | Terminal-first workflow, strong reasoning, agentic tasks, MCP integration |
| GitHub Copilot | IDE extension with inline suggestions and agent mode | Broad IDE support, native GitHub integration, multiple model choice |
| Amazon Kiro | Agentic IDE with specification driven workflows | Specs to design to tasks, steering files, agent hooks |
| Amazon Q Developer | AWS coding assistant in IDE, CLI, and console | AWS native software development lifecycle support, transformation capabilities |

- you need government MCP servers for standards compliance checking
- you need Gemini Code Assist for Google Cloud projects

## Claude Code models and task suitability

Claude Code uses Anthropic's Claude model family. Each model offers a different balance of capability, speed, and cost.

| Model | Strengths | Typical tasks |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | Deepest reasoning and complex code understanding | Architectural decisions, complex refactoring, difficult debugging |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Balanced reasoning and speed | General coding, feature development, test generation |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fastest responses, most cost effective | Quick edits, simple questions, boilerplate generation |

### Recommended model by task

| Task | Recommended model | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| Explore a large unfamiliar codebase | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Good balance of context understanding and speed |
| Debug a complex production issue | Claude Opus 4.5 | Deep reasoning about multi-layer problems |
| Write unit tests | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Sufficient for structured, repetitive patterns |
| Refactor legacy code | Claude Opus 4.5 | Needs deep understanding of code structure |
| Generate boilerplate | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Cost effective for simple patterns |
| Design API contracts | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Strong natural language and technical reasoning |
| Security code review | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Strong pattern recognition for vulnerabilities |
| Implement a complex algorithm | Claude Opus 4.5 | Superior mathematical reasoning |
| Answer quick questions | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast, sufficient for simple queries |

### Controlling model selection

You can select models when starting a Claude Code session or switch mid-session using `/model`. Claude Code will default to Sonnet unless you specify otherwise. For detailed model capabilities and limitations, see the [Claude models overview](https://anthropic.com/claude) and [AI model comparison](../comparative-guidance.md).

## UK government specific considerations

### Regulatory context

The UK uses a principle-based approach to AI regulation, working through existing legal frameworks and sector-specific guidance. Government departments must follow the AI Playbook for the UK Government, which sets out principles for using AI lawfully, ethically, and responsibly.

Key principles include safety, security, transparency, fairness, accountability, and governance.

### Security classification

The following table summarises acceptable use by security classification.

| Classification | Acceptable use |
|----------------|----------------|
| OFFICIAL | Generally acceptable with appropriate content exclusions configured |
| OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE | Requires risk assessment and strict content exclusions |
| SECRET and above | Not appropriate for use with Claude Code |

Consult your departmental security team before deployment. Reference [NCSC guidance on cloud services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles) for risk assessment.

### Content exclusions

You must configure Claude Code to exclude sensitive files and patterns. The following exclusions are recommended for government projects.

```
# Secrets and environment files
.env
.env.*
secrets/
*.key
*.pem
credentials

# AWS and cloud credentials
.aws/
api-keys/

# Configuration files
config/production.yml
terraform/production/

# Citizen data
citizen-data/
personal-identifiable-information/
user-data/

# Security configurations
security-configurations/
auth-config/
firewall-rules/
```

Add these patterns to a `.claude/settings.json` file at the root of your repository to prevent Claude Code from reading or indexing sensitive files.

### Data residency

Claude Code processes requests through Anthropic's infrastructure, hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the United States. UK and EEA-specific data residency is not available by default.

Check your department's data residency requirements and complete a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) before deployment. Reference your departmental data protection officer for guidance.

For departments with strict data residency requirements, consult the [data residency guidance](../data-residency.md).

### Intellectual property

Anthropic's terms of service state that code you submit is not used to train future models by default on paid plans. Verify your subscription terms before deployment.

For government projects, use a paid subscription tier only. Free and trial tiers do not provide the same data handling commitments.

### Procurement

Claude Code is available through:

- direct subscription from Anthropic for individual or team plans
- the DSIT AI Engineering Lab programme phase 1 licences
- Crown Commercial Service (CCS) G-Cloud framework for enterprise agreements

Check whether your department already holds a licence through the AI Engineering Lab programme before procuring separately.

## Getting started

### Licensing options

| Plan | Best for | Key features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Claude Pro | Individual engineers | Terminal and web access, Sonnet and Haiku models, reasonable usage limits |
| Claude Max | Power users and technical leads | Higher usage limits, priority access, Opus model access |
| API access | Teams and enterprise | Pay per token, full model access, team management, audit logs |

For government deployments, API access with a team account provides the most control over data handling, usage policies, and audit trails.

### Installation process

Complete the following steps to get a team started with Claude Code.

#### Step 1: team account setup

1. Create an Anthropic account or sign in at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
2. Set up a team workspace and invite engineers.
3. Configure usage limits and model access policies.
4. Enable usage logging for audit purposes.

#### Step 2: engineer installation

For macOS using Homebrew.

```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows using PowerShell.

```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

Verify the installation by running the following command.

```bash
claude --version
```

#### Step 3: authentication

Engineers authenticate using their Anthropic account or an API key from the team workspace. For team deployments, configure authentication through the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable to avoid engineers sharing individual keys.

#### Step 4: IDE integration

## Measuring success

### Quality metrics

For quality metrics refer to the [measurement playbook](../../quality-metrics/measurement-playbook.md) and [quality strategy](../../quality-metrics/quality-strategy.md) documentation.

## Common troubleshooting scenarios

### Claude Code not starting

Symptoms include:

- `claude` command not found in terminal
- error on launch about missing dependencies

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Verify installation completed successfully by running `claude --version`.
2. Check that Node.js 18 or later is installed by running `node --version`.
3. Reinstall using the native installer for your platform.
4. Restart your terminal session to reload the PATH variable.
5. Check the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) for platform-specific troubleshooting.

### Authentication errors

Symptoms include:

- prompts to log in repeatedly
- API key not recognised errors

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Verify your API key is valid at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
2. Check that the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly.
3. Confirm your subscription plan has not expired or exceeded its limit.
4. Sign out and back in using `/logout` followed by `claude login`.
5. Contact your team administrator to verify workspace access permissions.

### Poor response quality

Symptoms include:

- responses that do not match the project's patterns or conventions
- irrelevant or incorrect code generated

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Add a `CLAUDE.md` file to the project root with your team's coding standards and patterns.
2. Provide more context by referencing specific files in your prompt.
3. Break large complex requests into smaller, more focused tasks.
4. Specify the model you need for the task using `/model` if the default is insufficient.
5. See the [customisation guide](../../user-tool-guides/claude-code/customisation-guide.md) for detailed instructions on CLAUDE.md setup.

### Agent tasks failing or timing out

Symptoms include:

- agent tasks stopping partway through execution
- timeout errors on complex multi-file operations

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Break complex tasks into smaller bounded steps.
2. Confirm Claude Code has read access to all files it needs.
3. Review the task description for ambiguity and provide clearer instructions.
4. Monitor agent progress and provide clarification when requested.
5. Check your subscription plan has sufficient usage for long-running agent sessions.

### High token usage or unexpected costs

Symptoms include:

- usage limits reached sooner than expected
- higher than anticipated API costs

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Review usage logs at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) to identify high-usage sessions.
2. Use Claude Haiku 4.5 for simple tasks to reduce token costs.
3. Enable usage limits per engineer in the team workspace settings.
4. Review CLAUDE.md to ensure it does not include large unnecessary files in context.
5. Remind engineers to use `/clear` between unrelated tasks to reset context.

### Security incidents

If an engineer discovers or accepts code containing:

- hardcoded secrets or credentials
- known security vulnerabilities
- data protection violations

They must take the following immediate actions.

1. Do not commit the code.
2. Report to your security team using the standard incident process.
3. Document the suggestion for analysis.
4. Update content exclusions if pattern based.

They must follow up by:

- reviewing similar code in recent commits
- updating the team training materials
- sharing learning without blame

## Integration with development workflow

### Code review

All AI-generated code must go through the same code review process as human-written code. Reviewers should:

- check that generated code follows team conventions set out in CLAUDE.md
- verify that no sensitive data was included in Claude Code prompts
- confirm tests accompany all significant new code

### Git workflow

Claude Code can create commits, branches, and pull requests when given appropriate permissions. Teams should:

- restrict Claude Code Git access to feature branches only
- require human review before merging AI-assisted pull requests
- tag commits that include AI assistance for audit purposes

### Testing

Claude Code can generate unit tests, integration tests, and test data. Teams should:

- require engineers to verify generated tests cover the intended behaviour
- run the full test suite before accepting AI-generated changes
- use Claude Code to identify gaps in existing test coverage

### Continuous integration and continuous deployment

Teams should configure their continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipelines to:

- run security scanning on all code including AI-assisted code
- require all tests to pass before merging
- block deployments that include unreviewed AI-generated changes

## Policy configuration reference

### CLAUDE.md setup

A `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of a repository provides persistent instructions to Claude Code. Use it to enforce team standards across all sessions.

Example `CLAUDE.md` structure.

```markdown
# Project instructions for Claude Code

## Security requirements

Never read, modify, or reference files in the following directories:
- secrets/
- .env
- config/production/

Never suggest hardcoded credentials, API keys, or passwords.
Always recommend environment variables for configuration values.

## Coding standards

Follow Government Digital Service (GDS) coding standards.
Use British English in comments and documentation.
Write tests for all new functions.
Keep functions under 20 lines where possible.

## Review requirements

All generated code must be reviewed by a human before committing.
```

### IDE level settings

Example VS Code settings for Claude Code.

```json
{
  "claude-code.autostart": false,
  "claude-code.defaultModel": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "claude-code.showInlineCompletions": true
}
```

### Agent permission settings

Control what Claude Code can do autonomously by configuring approval requirements in your `.claude/settings.json` file.

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Read(*)",
      "Edit(src/**)",
      "Bash(git status, git diff, git log)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(git push, git merge, rm -rf)",
      "Edit(secrets/**, .env, config/production/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

This restricts Claude Code to reading all files, editing only source files, and running safe Git read commands. It prevents pushes, merges, and deletions.
