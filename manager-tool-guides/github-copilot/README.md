- basic software development lifecycle concepts
- your department's security classification requirements
- the [AI Engineering Lab maturity assessment](../../assessment/maturity-assessment-framework.md) framework

## What GitHub Copilot does

[GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot) provides real-time code suggestions directly in your team's development environment. It generates code completions, entire functions, tests, and documentation based on context from the current file.

Primary capabilities include:

- autocompleting code as engineers type
- generating implementation from function signatures or comments
- creating unit tests based on existing code
- producing documentation and code explanations
- suggesting fixes for errors and warnings

### Copilot interaction modes

GitHub Copilot offers several ways to interact with AI assistance, each suited for different tasks:

| Mode | Description | Best for | Available in |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Inline suggestions | Real-time completions as you type | Quick code completion, boilerplate | All tiers |
| Copilot Chat | Conversational interface in IDE | Explanations, debugging, questions | All tiers |
| Copilot Edits | Multi-file editing with AI assistance | Refactoring across files, applying patterns | Business and Enterprise |
| Copilot Workspace | Plan and implement features from issues | Feature planning, task breakdown | Enterprise only |
| Agent mode | Autonomous task execution with approval | Complex multi-step tasks, investigations | Enterprise only |

- inline suggestions for daily coding, implementing known patterns, and writing tests
- chat for understanding unfamiliar code, debugging errors, and generating documentation
- edits for renaming variables across files, applying security fixes, and refactoring
- workspace for planning new features, breaking down epics, and designing implementations
- agent mode for investigating bugs across codebase, migrating frameworks, and comprehensive refactoring

Agent mode can be extended with custom agents, hooks, and skills to enforce policies and automate repeatable workflows. Read the [GitHub Copilot customisation guide](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/customisation-guide.md) for more detail on these features.

### Best suited for

GitHub Copilot is best suited for:

- teams seeking productivity gains in routine coding tasks
- projects with substantial boilerplate or repetitive patterns
- accelerating test coverage creation
- supporting less experienced engineers with examples

### Not designed for

GitHub Copilot is not designed for:

- complex architectural decisions requiring codebase-wide understanding
- security-critical code generation without thorough review
- replacing code review and quality assurance processes
- full-stack application generation from requirements

## How it compares with other AI code assistants

For a detailed comparison of GitHub Copilot with other AI code assistants, see the [comparative guidance](../comparative-guidance.md). The [AI SDLC playbook](../../playbooks/ai-sdlc-playbook.md) covers integrating AI coding assistants across the full software development lifecycle.

### When to combine with other tools

Consider combining GitHub Copilot with other tools when:

- you need Claude Code for complex refactoring or architectural questions
- you need Claude with GitHub MCP server for AI-assisted code reviews, pull request analysis, and issue management
- you need Amazon Q for AWS-specific deployment tasks
- you need government MCP servers with Claude for standards compliance checking

### MCP servers and extended workflows

For detailed guidance on MCP servers and integration with other AI code assistants, see the MCP servers documentation in the AI Engineering Lab repository.

## Copilot models and task suitability

GitHub Copilot uses different models depending on the task. Understanding which model suits which task helps set appropriate expectations. The [model selection playbook](../../playbooks/model-selection.md) provides broader guidance on choosing the right AI tool across the AI Engineering Lab.

### Model comparison

The table below combines task suitability information from the [GitHub Copilot model comparison](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison) and cost multipliers from [supported AI models in GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models). Check both pages for the latest information, as the model catalogue changes regularly.

| Extended agentic sessions | GPT-5.1-Codex-Max | Optimised for sustained agent task execution |

### Controlling model selection

In Copilot Chat, engineers select models from the model picker dropdown. When using Auto mode, Copilot automatically selects the best model based on availability and stays within 0× to 1× multiplier models. This means it won't route to high-cost models such as Claude Opus. Read more about [Copilot auto model selection](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection). 

Included models (no premium requests on paid plans) are:

- GPT-4.1
- GPT-5 mini
- Raptor mini

Premium models (consume premium requests) are:

- all Claude models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus variants)
- GPT-5, GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, GPT-5.x-Codex
- Gemini models
- Grok Code Fast 1 (currently complimentary)

Model availability depends on your licence tier. Business and Enterprise tiers have access to all models. Premium model usage counts towards your organisation's monthly allowance.

For detailed guidance on managing premium request budgets, preventing unexpected costs, and understanding what happens when teams exceed their allowance, see [Premium credit management](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/premium-credit-management.md).

### Adding additional models

You can add more models beyond those available by default using your own API keys. This allows access to:

- additional model versions
- models from other providers
- local or self-hosted models

For configuration details, see [Changing the AI model for GitHub Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/change-the-chat-model).

For detailed model capabilities and limitations, see:

- [GitHub Copilot supported models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/supported-models)
- [AI model comparison](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/ai-models/model-comparison)

## Government-specific considerations

Check the [base guardrails](../../governance/guardrails-base.md) for foundational security controls that apply to all AI tool usage.

### Security classification

GitHub Copilot sends code snippets to GitHub's servers for processing. This means:

- OFFICIAL: generally acceptable with appropriate content exclusions configured
- OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE: requires risk assessment and strict content exclusions
- SECRET and above: not appropriate for these classifications

Consult your departmental security team before deployment. Reference [NCSC guidance on cloud services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles) for risk assessment and [NCSC secure development and deployment guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/developers-collection) for security best practices. The [Copilot Trust Center](https://resources.github.com/copilot-trust-center/) provides GitHub's security, privacy, and compliance information for Copilot.

### Content exclusions

You must [configure Copilot to exclude sensitive files and patterns](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/setting-policies-for-copilot-in-your-organization/excluding-content-from-github-copilot). Recommended exclusions for government projects:

```yaml
# Environment and configuration files
/.env
/.env.
/secrets/
/config/production.yml
/config/production/

# AWS and API credentials
/credentials
/aws/config
/.aws/
/api-keys/

# Department-specific patterns
/citizen-data/
/personal-identifiable-information/
/security-configurations/
```

### Data residency

As of January 2025, GitHub Copilot processes requests through Azure OpenAI Service. Check your department's data residency requirements before deployment.

### Intellectual property

Copilot Business and Enterprise tiers include IP indemnity, meaning GitHub provides legal protection if generated code infringes copyright. Individual tier does not include this protection.

For government projects, use Business or Enterprise tier only.

## Getting started

GitHub Copilot is available through [Crown Commercial Service G-Cloud 14](https://www.crowncommercial.gov.uk/agreements/RM1557.14) ([search for GitHub Enterprise and Copilot on the Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/)) or the [TechUK Software Reseller Framework](https://www.techuk.org/) through authorised resellers.

### Installation process

The [GitHub Copilot getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot) covers full setup options. To get started, complete the following steps.

#### Step 1: organisation setup

1. Enable Copilot in your GitHub organisation settings.
2. Configure content exclusion policies.
3. Assign licences to pilot users.
4. Enable usage metrics collection.

#### Step 2: engineer installation

## Managing agent mode and premium credit spend

Agent mode is one of the most productive features in GitHub Copilot, but it is also the most likely to exhaust an engineer's monthly premium request allowance when used with premium models. This section gives administrators the controls they need to prevent unexpected costs across their teams.

Before diving into the admin controls, it helps to understand how engineers actually use agent mode day to day and what tasks they are likely to run in it. The [GitHub Copilot advanced use guide](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/advanced-use.md) covers refactoring, test generation, and multi-file editing patterns. These are the tasks most likely to drive credit consumption. The [GitHub Copilot customisation guide](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/customisation-guide.md) covers custom agents, hooks for security and cost logging, and skills. All of these interact with agent mode and affect how your team uses it at scale.

### Understanding how agent mode consumes credits

[Each prompt an engineer sends in agent mode counts as one premium request, multiplied by the selected model's multiplier](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/copilot-chat/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide). Internal tool calls the agent makes between prompts, such as reading files or running terminal commands, are not charged separately. Only the prompts the engineer sends trigger a charge.

Complex tasks require many messages. On a Business plan (300 requests per user per month), two or three feature implementation sessions with a premium model can exhaust an engineer's entire monthly allowance. GitHub Copilot does not warn engineers before a premium request is charged and there is no automatic notification when an individual approaches their limit.

For worked examples of credit consumption across different task types and model choices, see the [agent mode billing guide](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/agent-mode-billing.md).

### Restricting which models engineers can use

As an enterprise or organisation owner, you can disable premium models to prevent engineers from selecting them in agent mode and chat. [Model policies apply equally to all Copilot features including agent mode](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/use-ai-models/configure-access-to-ai-models). There is no separate policy for agent mode alone. [Auto model selection also respects these restrictions](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection) and will not route to a disabled model.

Disabling a model removes it from both Auto routing and manual selection. Engineers cannot use a model you have disabled, even if they choose it themselves. Administrators cannot set a default model for engineers. GitHub controls the platform-wide default, which has been GPT-4.1 since May 2025.

For the full step-by-step procedure, including how to enforce included-only model use and a middle-ground option that keeps low-cost premium models available, see [Enforcing included model use through model policies](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/agent-mode-billing.md#enforcing-included-model-use-through-model-policies) in the agent mode billing guide.

### Setting a hard spending limit

You can set a monthly budget and enable a hard limit to automatically block premium requests once the budget is exhausted. Once the limit is reached, engineers are switched to included models automatically and no further charges accrue. This is the recommended configuration for cost governance. The [premium request paid usage policy](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/manage-and-track-spending/manage-request-allowances) has been available for Business and Enterprise plans since August 2025.

Since November 2025, the Copilot coding agent has its own dedicated stock keeping unit (SKU) separate from chat and agent mode in the IDE. This allows you to set separate budgets for each feature if you want more detailed control.

For the full procedure including budget configuration, alert thresholds, and the difference between hard and soft limits, see [Managing premium credits](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/premium-credit-management.md#managing-premium-credits) in the premium credit management guide.

### Monitoring usage by engineer

[Download monthly usage reports](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use) to identify which engineers are consuming the most premium requests and which models they are using. Filter by feature and model to identify agent mode usage specifically.

Contact engineers who are consistently near or over their allowance. Share the [premium credit management guide](../../user-tool-guides/github-copilot/premium-credit-management.md) to help them understand how to reduce consumption and choose appropriate models for each task type.

### What to communicate to engineers

Engineers may not realise how quickly agent mode sessions with premium models consume requests. Sharing the following points with your team will help:

- agent mode with included models (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, GPT-5 mini) costs nothing, so encourage engineers to use these as their default
- [Auto model selection stays within 0× to 1× multiplier models](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/auto-model-selection) and gives a 10% discount on paid plans, making it a safe default if engineers want automatic model selection
- premium models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.5 should be reserved for tasks that genuinely require advanced reasoning
- [the Copilot coding agent on GitHub.com uses one premium request per session](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-07-10-github-copilot-coding-agent-now-uses-one-premium-request-per-session/) regardless of task complexity, making it far more cost-effective than agent mode chat for large, multi-file tasks

## Measuring success

### Quality metrics

For quality metrics refer to the monitoring and evaluation framework documentation. For usage data specific to GitHub Copilot, see the [usage metrics and reporting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/reviewing-usage-data-for-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Common troubleshooting scenarios

#### Inline suggestions not appearing

Symptoms include:

- no autocomplete suggestions while typing
- extension appears inactive

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Verify extension is enabled and authenticated in IDE settings.
2. Check that file type is not excluded in Copilot settings.
3. Ensure inline suggestions are enabled: `"editor.inlineSuggest.enabled": true`.
4. Restart IDE and check network connectivity.
5. Sign out and sign back in to refresh authentication.

#### Copilot Chat not responding

Symptoms include:

- the chat window opening with no responses
- error messages in chat interface

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Check GitHub service status at [githubstatus.com](https://www.githubstatus.com/).
2. Verify licence is active in GitHub organisation settings.
3. Clear chat history and restart conversation.
4. Check corporate proxy or firewall allows Copilot endpoints.
5. Update to latest extension version.

#### Agent mode failures

Symptoms include:

- agent tasks failing to complete
- timeout errors or incomplete work

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Break down complex tasks into smaller, more specific requests.
2. Ensure agent has sufficient permissions for requested operations.
3. Check repository size and complexity (very large repos may struggle).
4. Review task requirements. Agent works best with clear, bounded objectives.
5. Monitor agent progress and provide clarifications when requested.

For detailed troubleshooting of Copilot agent mode specifically, see [Troubleshooting GitHub Copilot coding agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-github-copilot-coding-agent-in-your-ide/troubleshooting-github-copilot-coding-agent).

#### Poor suggestion quality

Symptoms include:

- suggestions not matching project patterns
- irrelevant or incorrect code generated

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Provide more context via descriptive comments and function signatures.
2. Ensure relevant imports and dependencies are visible in file.
3. Use more specific variable and function names.
4. Check if content exclusions are blocking helpful context.
5. Try using Copilot Chat for complex scenarios instead of inline.
6. For Enterprise customers, verify custom model fine-tuning is configured.

Understanding how to communicate with Copilot effectively can dramatically improve suggestion quality. See the [prompt library](../../prompt-library/) for tested prompts and patterns. GitHub's [Copilot best practices guide](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/how-to-use-github-copilot-in-your-ide-tips-tricks-and-best-practices/) also covers effective usage patterns and tips.

#### Performance issues

Symptoms include:

- slow suggestion generation
- IDE lagging when Copilot is active

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Reduce the number of active IDE extensions.
2. Check network connectivity and latency.
3. Clear extension cache and reload IDE.
4. Update to latest Copilot extension version.
5. Check system resources (CPU, memory).

#### Enterprise-specific issues

Symptoms include:

- licence assignment not working
- policy changes not taking effect
- usage metrics not appearing

Follow these steps to resolve the issue.

1. Verify user is member of correct GitHub organisation.
2. Check seat assignment in organisation Copilot settings.
3. Allow 15 to 30 minutes for policy changes to propagate.
4. Ensure user has signed out and back in after policy updates.
5. Contact GitHub support for billing or access issues.

### Security incidents

If an engineer discovers or accepts code containing:

- hardcoded secrets or credentials
- known security vulnerabilities
- data protection violations

They must take the following immediate actions.

1. Do not commit the code.
2. Report to your security team using standard incident process.
3. Document the suggestion for analysis.
4. Update content exclusions if pattern-based.

They must follow up by:

- reviewing similar code in recent commits
- updating the team training materials
- sharing learning without blame

## Policy configuration reference

### Recommended content exclusions

```yaml
# Secrets and credentials
/.env
/.env.
/secrets/
/*.key
/*.pem
/credentials
/.aws/

# Configuration files
/config/production.yml
/config/production/
/terraform/production/

# Citizen data
/citizen-data/
/personal-identifiable-information/
/user-data/

# Security configurations
/security-configurations/
/auth-config/
/firewall-rules/

# Legacy code (if applicable)
/legacy/
/deprecated/
```

### IDE-level settings

Example VS Code configuration:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.enable": {
    "*": true,
    "yaml": false,
    "plaintext": false,
    "markdown": true
  },
  "github.copilot.editor.enableAutoCompletions": true,
