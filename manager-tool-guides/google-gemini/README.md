## Before you start

Before reading this guide, you should understand:

- your team's current development workflow and tooling
- your department's security classification requirements
- the [AI Engineering Lab maturity assessment](../../assessment/maturity-assessment-framework.md) framework
- basic software development lifecycle concepts

## What Gemini Code Assist does

Google Gemini Code Assist provides AI-powered assistance throughout the software development lifecycle. It generates code suggestions, explains existing code, and helps with development tasks directly in your integrated development environment (IDE). It has deep integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

Gemini Code Assist can:

- autocomplete code as engineers type
- generate code from comments or function signatures
- create and update unit tests
- explain code and answer technical questions
- assist with GCP service integration
- transform and refactor code across multiple files
- index and understand entire codebases (up to 1 million token context window)

### Editions

| Edition | Target audience | Differences |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Individual (free) | Students, hobbyists, freelancers | 6,000 completions per day, 240 chat sessions per day |
| Standard | Teams and businesses | Enterprise security, management tools, intellectual property (IP) indemnification |
| Enterprise | Large organisations | All Standard features plus code customisation from private repositories |

### Interaction modes

| Mode | Best for |
|------|----------|
| Inline suggestions | Daily coding, implementing patterns, writing boilerplate |
| Next edit predictions | Related changes across a file |
| Gemini Chat | Explanations, debugging, architecture questions |
| Agent mode | Complex multi-file refactoring, feature implementation |

### Agent mode

Agent mode handles complex tasks spanning multiple files. It analyses your codebase, proposes a plan for your review, then executes changes with your oversight at each step.

Gemini Code Assist tools were deprecated on 14 October 2025. External service integrations now use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in agent mode.

## How it compares with other AI Engineering Lab tools

| Capability | Gemini Code Assist | GitHub Copilot | Amazon Q Developer | Claude Code |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inline completion | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Not available |
| Chat assistance | Excellent | Good | Good | Excellent |
| Agent mode | Yes | Yes (preview) | Limited | Yes |
| Codebase understanding | Up to 2 million tokens | Current file focus | Repository-wide | Multi-file context |
| GCP integration | Native | Limited | Limited | Via MCP |
| AWS integration | Limited | Limited | Native | Via MCP |
| Primary use case | GCP workflows | Fast completion | AWS workflows | Reasoning tasks |

Choose Gemini Code Assist when:

- your team primarily works with Google Cloud Platform
- you need agent mode for complex, multi-step coding tasks
- you need large-scale code transformation for migrations
- your infrastructure is GCP-based

Consider combining with other tools to:

- use GitHub Copilot for faster inline completions in non-GCP contexts
- use Claude Code for complex architectural reasoning

## Government-specific considerations

### Security classification

Gemini Code Assist processes code through Google Cloud Platform services. The following security classifications apply:

- OFFICIAL: generally acceptable with content exclusions configured
- OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE: requires risk assessment and strict content exclusions
- SECRET and above: not appropriate

Check with your security team before you start. Reference [National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) guidance on cloud services](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/cloud/the-cloud-security-principles) for risk assessment.

### Content exclusions

You must configure Gemini Code Assist to exclude sensitive files. See the [policy configuration reference](#policy-configuration-reference) for recommended exclusion patterns.

### Data residency

Data residency considerations state:

- code suggestions are processed in configurable GCP regions
- customer code is not stored or used for model training
- UK and EU data residency options are available

Check your department's data residency requirements before deployment.

### Central deployment model

The AI Engineering Lab uses a central deployment model including:

- a central GCP enterprise account managed by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT)
- users receiving credentials to plug into their IDEs
- individual departments controlling access and usage

### Intellectual property

Gemini Code Assist Enterprise includes IP indemnity. For government projects, use the Enterprise edition only.

## Common implementation challenges

### Engineers not using the tool

Symptoms include low activation rates, acceptance rates below 15%, and feedback that suggestions are not helpful.

1. Check that content exclusions are not too restrictive.
2. Provide pairing sessions with effective users.
3. Share specific use case examples.

### Security concerns from team

Symptoms include engineers questioning suggestions and reluctance to accept generated code.

1. Clarify that the code review process remains unchanged.
2. Share Google Cloud data protection commitments.
3. Conduct a security workshop with examples.

### Over-reliance on suggestions

Symptoms include decreased code review thoroughness and accepting suggestions without understanding.

1. Reinforce code review standards.
2. Include 'understanding of implementation' in review checklists.
3. Pair junior engineers with seniors during adoption.

### Resistance to adoption

| Persona | Characteristics | What to do |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Sceptical | Doubt the value, need proof | Live demonstrations, show small wins |
| Worried | Fear job loss or skill devaluation | Reframe as helping with repetitive tasks |
| Overloaded | Too much change happening | Go slower, show quick wins that save time |
| Opposed | Actively resistant | Peer influence first, escalation if needed |

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Common causes | First steps |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| Suggestions not appearing | Extension disabled, authentication expired, file type excluded | Check extension is enabled, sign out and back in, verify file type is supported |
| Chat not responding | Service outage, licence inactive, firewall blocking | Check GCP status, verify licence in console, check firewall rules |
| Agent mode failures | Task too complex, insufficient permissions, MCP misconfigured | Break task into smaller requests, check permissions, verify MCP connections |
| Poor suggestion quality | Limited context, exclusions too restrictive | Add descriptive comments, check exclusion settings, open relevant files |
| Performance issues | Too many extensions, network latency | Reduce active extensions, check network connectivity |

For persistent issues, contact your team's champion or raise a support ticket.

### Security incidents

If an engineer discovers code containing hardcoded secrets, vulnerabilities, or data protection issues:

- do not commit the code
- report to your security team using the standard incident process
- document the suggestion for analysis
- update content exclusions if the issue is pattern-based

## Integration with development workflow

### Code review process

Gemini Code Assist-generated code should pass through the same review process as human-written code.

Reviewers should check:

- logic correctness and edge case handling
- if there's hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- compliance with team coding standards
- that the reviewer understands the implementation

### Git workflow

You do not need to change your Git workflow. Gemini Code Assist works in your IDE and does not affect commits, branches, or merges.

### Testing strategy

Treat generated code as untested until you have tested it.

1. Generate test scaffolding via Gemini, then review and enhance.
2. Manually verify GCP service interactions.
3. Run static application security testing (SAST) tools on all code.
4. Code review remains mandatory.

### Continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline

No changes required. Ensure existing quality gates remain in place. Generated code must pass all gates before merging.

## Security best practices

### For managers

Managers should:

- configure content exclusions before any engineer access
- review exclusion patterns quarterly or after incidents
- enable usage analytics via GCP console
- establish a clear escalation path for security concerns
- maintain an approved MCP server registry for your department

### For engineers

Engineers should:

- never accept suggestions containing API keys, passwords, or tokens
- review security-critical code with extra scrutiny
- verify generated SQL queries for injection vulnerabilities
- review agent mode plans before approval
- only use MCP servers from your department's approved registry

### When to avoid Gemini Code Assist

Avoid using Gemini Code Assist for:

- implementing cryptographic algorithms
- writing security controls (authentication, authorisation)
- processing citizen data or personal information
- configuring production Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies without validation

## Policy configuration reference

### Recommended content exclusions

Configure in GCP console under Gemini Code Assist settings.

Exclude the following:

- environment and secrets files (`.env`, `secrets/`, `*.key`, `*.pem`)
- GCP credentials (`service-account-*.json`, `.gcloud/`)
- production configuration (`config/production/`, `terraform/production/`)
- citizen data directories
- security configurations

For the full exclusion pattern list, see the [content exclusions documentation](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/content-exclusions).

### Organisation-level settings

Configure the organisation-level settings in GCP console.

1. Go to GCP Console, then Gemini Code Assist.
2. Assign users via IAM.
3. Configure content exclusions.
4. Set up usage analytics.
5. Configure data residency preferences.
