# Welcome to the AI Engineering Lab Repository 

## What is this? 

AI Engineering Lab (AIEL) is led by the Engineering Excellence team in the Government Digital Service (GDS). 

The role of AIEL is to drive sustained and impactful adoption of AI coding assistants in software engineering teams across the public sector. Its main aims are to integrate AI tooling for teams throughout the entire software development lifecycle, to upskill government digital and data professionals, and to monitor and evaluate where AI tooling can enhance digital service delivery.

This repo is a live resource and will be continually updated. It will contain: 

- training materials 

- best practice guidance 

- useful examples and templates
