## Who this repository is for

This repository is for:

- software engineers and engineers seeking practical guidance on using AI assistants effectively
- technical leads and architects establishing team standards and patterns
- delivery managers and product owners planning adoption within their teams
- senior responsible owners requiring governance and compliance assurance
- forward deployed engineers supporting intensive adoption engagements

## Quick start by role

### I'm an engineer wanting to use AI code assistants:

1. Read the [AI-SDLC Playbook](playbooks/ai-sdlc-playbook.md) for integration guidance.
2. Review the [Guardrails](governance/guardrails-base.md) to understand usage boundaries.
3. Explore the [Prompt Library](prompt-library/README.md) for proven patterns.

### I'm a technical lead setting up my team:

1. Review [Context Engineering](playbooks/context-engineering.md) for repository setup.
2. Establish baseline metrics using the [Quality Strategy](quality-metrics/quality-strategy.md).
3. Consider requesting [FDE support](#forward-deployed-engineering-support) for your rollout.


### I'm a manager selecting tools for my department:

1. Start with [Comparative Guidance](manager-tool-guides/comparative-guidance.md).
2. Review tool-specific guides: [GitHub Copilot](manager-tool-guides/copilot/README.md) and [Amazon Q](manager-tool-guides/amazon-q/README.md).
3. Review the [Model Selection Playbook](playbooks/model-selection.md).

### I'm a senior responsible owner needing governance assurance:

1. Review all governance documentation in the governance folder.
2. Understand the 'Risk register template'.
3. Review the 'Incident response playbook'.


## Forward deployed engineering support

The programme maintains a pool of expert senior engineers with extensive AI assistant experience. Forward deployed engineers provide intensive, hands-on support for teams requiring additional help.

Forward deployed engineering support is appropriate for:

- teams with low AI maturity requiring intensive guidance
- complex technical environments or niche requirements
- important adoption challenges requiring immediate intervention
- capturing learnings for repository enhancement

To request forward deployed engineering support:

1. Complete the readiness checklist.
2. Submit a request via the team (contact details to be confirmed).
3. Await triage and allocation (typical response time to be confirmed).
