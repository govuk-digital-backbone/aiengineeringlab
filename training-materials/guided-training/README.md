# Guided Training

> Instructor-led workshops and facilitated learning sessions for AI Engineering Lab adoption.

## Purpose

Guided training provides structured, facilitated learning experiences for teams adopting AI Engineering Labs. These sessions combine expert instruction with hands-on practice, discussion, and real-time support.

Use guided training when:

- Teams are new to AI Engineering Labs (Starting maturity)
- Complex topics require discussion and Q&A
- Teams benefit from learning together
- Hands-on practice needs real-time guidance
- Change management requires face-to-face engagement

For self-directed learning options, see [Self-paced modules](../self-paced/README.md).
