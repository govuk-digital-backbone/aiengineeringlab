## Books

| Title | Author(s) | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Co-Intelligence: The Definitive, Bestselling Guide to Living and Working with AI | Ethan Mollick | The urgent and definitive guide to working, learning, and living in the new age of artificial intelligence from the acclaimed Wharton Professor of Management and author of the One Useful Thing Substack. |
| Competing in the Age of AI: Strategy and Leadership When Algorithms and Networks Run the World | Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani | This book presents a framework for rethinking business and operating models in the AI era, explaining how collisions between AI-driven digital firms and traditional analogue companies are reshaping competition and the economy. It describes opportunities and risks created by digital firms and outlines new challenges for leaders of both digital and traditional organisations, packed with examples from powerful AI-driven competitors based on research across hundreds of firms. |
| Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions | Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths | This book explores how computer algorithms can be applied to everyday human decision-making problems, showing how solutions developed by computer scientists for limited space and time constraints can illuminate very human questions. The authors explain concepts like optimal stopping, explore and exploit trade-offs, sorting, caching, scheduling, and Bayesian reasoning, transforming computational wisdom into practical strategies for finding a spouse, organising an inbox, making better hunches, dealing with overwhelming choices, and understanding human memory. |
| Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control | Stuart Russell | Stuart Russell, a leading AI researcher, explains why he considers artificial intelligence an existential threat to humanity and how we can change course. Through brilliant analogies and lucid prose, he explains how AI works, its enormous capacity to improve lives, and why we must ensure we never lose control of machines more powerful than we are. |
| The Alignment Problem |  Brian Christian | Exploration of everything that goes wrong when we build AI systems and the movement to fix them. This book examines the alignment problem—how to get machines to behave in accordance with human norms and values—through interviews with researchers working on challenges from biased algorithms in hiring and criminal justice to autonomous vehicles. |
| A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence | Jeff Hawkins | Jeff Hawkins unveils a revolutionary theory of how the brain creates intelligence. He and his team discovered that the brain uses map-like structures to build not just one model of the world, but hundreds of thousands of models through cortical columns in the neocortex. This Thousand Brains Theory explains how we perceive the world, why we have a sense of self, and the origin of high-level thought. The book also explores the consequences of creating truly intelligent machines and examines existential threats posed by both human and machine intelligence. |
