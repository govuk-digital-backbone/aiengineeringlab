# Claude Code: user guide

## Purpose

This guide helps engineers use Claude Code effectively in their daily workflow. It covers practical usage patterns, terminal-based development, advanced features, and integration.

## Who this is for

This guide is for:

- engineers writing code, maintaining and refactoring codebases
- engineers maintaining and refactoring legacy systems
- teams adopting AI-assisted development tools

## What Claude Code does

Claude Code is Anthropic's AI-powered coding assistant that works in your terminal, IDE, or web browser. It helps you write, understand, debug, and refactor code through conversational interaction.

### Core capabilities

| Capability | What it does |
|------------|--------------|
| Codebase exploration | Understands entire repositories, navigates dependencies, finds patterns |
| Multi-file editing | Makes changes across multiple files whilst maintaining consistency |
| Command execution | Runs tests, builds, lints, Git operations, and any CLI tool |
| Documentation | Generates and maintains code documentation, API references, and technical guides |
| Testing | Generates test cases, creates test data, runs test suites |
| Debugging | Analyses errors, identifies root causes, suggests fixes |
| Refactoring | Modernises legacy code, applies patterns, improves structure |
| Workflow integration | Works with GitHub, GitLab, and development tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers |

### How it works

You can use Claude Code:

- in your terminal for conversational command-line interface for development workflows
- integrated with your IDE for visual editing in Visual Studio (VS) Code or JetBrains IDEs
- on the web for browser-based access at [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) with no installation required
