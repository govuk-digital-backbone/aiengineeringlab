# Advanced use of GitHub Copilot

This guide builds on the [getting started guide for GitHub Copilot](getting-started.md). It is for developers who already use Copilot regularly and want to use it more effectively and safely.

Follow the steps in order. Each step focuses on a specific capability.

## Who this guide is for

This guide is for:

- developers who already use GitHub Copilot day to day
- engineers working on production codebases
- developers supporting or mentoring others

You should already be comfortable reviewing and committing Copilot generated code.

## What this guide covers

This guide focuses on:

- improving prompt quality
- working with existing codebases
- generating tests and documentation
- refactoring safely
- understanding limitations

## Contents

Use the following steps.

1. Improve how you write prompts.
2. Use Copilot with existing code.
3. Generate tests and documentation.
4. Refactor code safely.
5. Understand limits and failure modes.

## 1. Improve how you write prompts

Good prompts lead to better results.

You can [improve prompt quality](../../playbooks/prompt-engineering/) by clearly describing what the code should do rather than how it should be written, including any relevant constraints such as performance or readability, and referencing existing functions or patterns already used in the codebase.

You can prompt Copilot effectively by:

- describing behaviour in a comment before writing code
- asking Copilot to explain code before asking it to change it
- asking for small changes rather than large rewrites

Consider:

- treating Copilot like a junior developer
- always reviewing suggestions before accepting them

## 2. Use Copilot with existing code

Copilot is most valuable in real codebases, not empty files.

You can use Copilot to understand unfamiliar code, summarise files or functions, and suggest potential improvements or fixes before making changes yourself.
Provide your feedback on BizChat

Work more effectively with existing code by:

- asking Copilot to explain a file before editing it
- asking Copilot to describe the impact of a proposed change
- using Copilot Chat to explore options rather than make final decisions

Reduce risk when working with Copilot by:

- never assuming Copilot understands business context
- verifying behaviour with tests and local runs

## 3. Generate tests and documentation

Copilot can help create tests and documentation, but only with guidance.

Use Copilot to generate tests for existing functions. You should explicitly specify the test framework used by your project. Then, manually review the resulting tests to make sure they provide meaningful coverage and handle important edge cases.

For documentation:

- ask Copilot to summarise code behaviour
- use it to draft README content
- rewrite generated documentation in plain English

You can improve the quality of outputs by:

- ensuring generated tests still fail when code breaks
- ensuring documentation reflects real behaviour rather than intent

- [Test with GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/guides/test-with-copilot)

## 4. Refactor code safely

Copilot can assist with refactoring, but it should not drive it.

Safe refactoring practices include making one logical change at a time, asking Copilot to suggest refactoring options rather than applying changes blindly, and running tests after each change to ensure behaviour remains correct.

You can use Copilot effectively during refactoring by:

- identifying duplication
- suggesting smaller functions
- renaming variables for clarity

You can refactor more safely by:

- avoiding large multi file changes generated in one step
- keeping changes reviewable in pull requests

## 5. Understand limits and failure modes

Copilot is not aware of organisational standards, architectural decisions, or security and compliance requirements, so its suggestions must always be reviewed in the context of your organisation’s policies and constraints.

Common failure modes include:

- confident but incorrect code
- insecure defaults
- outdated patterns

Build good habits when using Copilot by:

- questioning suggestions that look complex
- checking dependencies and licences
- preferring simple readable code

## Working with others

When using Copilot in team environments, be open about when Copilot has been used, continue to follow existing review processes, and never bypass established checks or approval requirements.

Copilot should support collaboration, not replace it.

## Next steps

You can now:

- refine your prompt style over time
- help others learn effective usage
- contribute feedback and improvements

GitHub Copilot is a tool. You remain accountable for the code you ship.
